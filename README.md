### A better way to check you inbox.

1. The first step to organizing your Gmail is to select your preferred layout.

When you open your inbox, click on the gear symbol in the upper right corner and select “Settings.” Then along the top of the settings window, click on the “Inbox” tab. From here, Gmail gives you five layout options for your inbox.

- Default: This is the standard format which organizes your Gmail by date an email is received. In this view, you can select different categories in which your emails are placed. They appear as tabs at the top of your screen and can be helpful in determining which of your emails are likely to be more important.

- Important First: In this view, Gmail tries to predict which emails you are most important (noted with a yellow marker) and displays those messages in a top inbox. Your less important messages are displayed in a lower inbox at the bottom of your screen.

- Unread First: This view is similar to the Important First option, however your top inbox includes messages you haven’t opened yet, while the bottom inbox would include everything else.

- Starred First: Your Starred First view also splits your inbox into two fields and displays only the emails you’ve starred in the top view. Everything else appears in the second view below

- Priority Inbox: This is like a combination of all of the views. Gmail uses predictive analysis to determine which emails you’re most likely to interactive with based on past actions. It then puts those emails into the top view.
